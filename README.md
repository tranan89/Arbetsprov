Notes
* Since the focus of this task was HTML/CSS I skipped redux and production config for webpack in order to save a bit of time. I do however regret skipping redux a bit since the code structure got a bit messier than I thought it would
* If you would like to see redux and/or production config for webpack. I might have time to fix that next week
